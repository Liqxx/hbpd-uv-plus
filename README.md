## Warning
The drivers described in this repository carry the potential to emit intense ultraviolet light and high peak-power laser radiation when used with light emitting diodes or laser diodes. Exposure to these optical pulses can lead to adverse health effects and permanent vision damage.

It is the user's full responsibility to adhere to appropriate laser safety procedures to avoid any eye or skin exposure and related health consequences.
